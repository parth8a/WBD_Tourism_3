Right after college, she set out to achieve this dream by building Discover Delhi with help from her family & college friends, Rajnish & Kavi. She hopes she has succeeded in sharing the charm of the city! </td>
        <td> While Rajnish does not believe in magic, he concedes Delhi has its charms. A practical & level-headed guy, he looks after the "boring stuff" that keeps our company going. You can reply on him to suggest the best food joints though!</td>
        <td> What's a CTO? Chief Trip Officer, ofcourse! Kavi has a knack for curating  experiences by blending fun activities, beautiful sights, and mouth-watering food (with help from Rajnish in this department) making every trip memorable for our visitors. You can also rely on him to know every nook & corner of the city, making our trips a truly unique adventure! </td>

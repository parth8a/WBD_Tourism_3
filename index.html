                <p>While there is plenty to read about it in books, hear it in songs and, watch in movies, no experience parallels a walk down the vibrant streets and hustle bustle of Chandi Chowk.
                Said to be one of  <b>Asia's oldest markets</b>, it was established back in the 1650's by the Mughal Emperor Shahjahan. Chandni Chowk's charm lies in its extraordinary, culture-rich streets which have seen everything from the rule of the Mughals and the crowning of British Emperor's, to the making of kebab shops that one can't miss.</p>
                
                <p>The streets, the architecture and all its people that claim them each day, tie in the glory of its history and its ever changing present by giving us a beautiful glimpse into the art that is modernity and the everyday.
                It obviously is also surrounded by architectural wonders like the Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Shankar Temple, etc, that bring religious and historical harmony together that deserve a standalone visit of their own.</p>
